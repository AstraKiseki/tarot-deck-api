# tarot-deck-api
The nascent code for a tarot deck api that will include meanings, descriptions, and more.

## Welcome!  This code will have room for decks, cards, and in the future, spreads.
Right now, it's still under construction while I work on the database and the objects.

(That said, it'll require admin access to do more than just look at cards and decks, I think.  I'll decide on that in time.)
